# 3D-Joint-Design
This project contains a 3D joint design created using Onshape.

## Overview
This project contains a 3D joint design created using Onshape. The joint has been improved by increasing the thickness and modifying the **fillet to achieve better performance and higher load-bearing capacity. The goal of this project is to design a robust joint using mechanical engineering principles, with the ability to perform **Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to ensure its efficiency in practical applications.

## Project Contents
- 3D Joint Design: The joint has been designed using **Onshape.
- STEP File: Contains the design saved in **STEP format, which can be imported into software like Fusion 360, **SolidWorks, or **FreeCAD for FEA analysis.
- Improvements: The thickness has been increased from 6 mm to 8 mm, and the **fillet has been increased for better load distribution and reduced stress concentration.

## Key Dimensions
- Outer Diameter: 50 mm
- Thickness: 8 mm
- Fillet: Increased **radius for improved load distribution.
- Holes: Hole diameter is 6 mm for bolts.
## How to Use the Project
1. Design:
   - Download the STEP file from this repository.
   - Open the file in a 3D design software like Fusion 360, **SolidWorks, or **FreeCAD.
   
2. FEA Analysis:
   - Import the model into FEA tools like Fusion 360 or FreeCAD.
   - Define the loads and boundary conditions.
   - Run the analysis to review the stress and deformation in the joint.

## Analysis Notes
- Increased Thickness: The thickness has been increased to 8 mm to provide stronger support for the joint under heavy loads.
- Fillet Increase: The fillet has been modified to improve stress distribution and avoid excessive concentration at the edges.

## Tools Used
- Onshape: The cloud-based software used for 3D joint design.
- FEA Tools: Finite Element Analysis tools in programs like **Fusion 360 or FreeCAD.
